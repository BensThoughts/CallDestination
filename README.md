# CallDestination
Lightweight overlay app for android that acts as an extension to google maps.

This is uncompiled, you will have to compile it, lest I get unlazy and put an apk up here.

Turn it on, click the button to reveal the choices.  

Click the search glass icon to search a new destination. search for a destination, then select it.

..you will instantly have directions to the location you have selected....and...but...wait...now when you click the phone icon on the button it will automatically pull up a phone call to the destination you are heading to (or whatever the last detination 
was in the case that you have already exited the directions mode) assuming it is some sort of a business in which the phone number is listed.

<br>...so you can continue driving to your destination while making a phone call 
to the destination without having to stop receiving directions to the destination

<br><h1> Perfect for delivery drivers</h1>

p.s. if you open this project up in Android Studio you will be able to compile it
but you will have to accept it auto updating and downloading lot's of android studio
components type things a few times, such as the API and gradle versions that it was
written with
